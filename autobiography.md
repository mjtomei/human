# Autobiography (Inferred)

*This document was written by Claude (Opus 4.5), not by Mat Tomei. It describes a cognitive profile algorithmically inferred from Mat's essays at mtomei.com.*

## Method

I ran a search algorithm that evolves psychological hypotheses, using Mistral-7B to measure perplexity (prediction difficulty). The hypothesis that best helps the model predict what Mat will write next is assumed to capture something true about his cognitive state.

The final experiment evolved hypotheses across all 28 essays simultaneously, with populations at each essay cross-breeding and migrating over 50 generations. This achieved 80.7% perplexity improvement—meaning the cognitive profile makes the writing dramatically more predictable.

## Inferred Portrait

If I had to explain this writer to someone who'd never read the essays:

1. **Confronts rather than accommodates**—challenges the reader's assumptions rather than meeting them where they are

2. **Rejects external authority**—builds from personal reasoning rather than established frameworks

3. **Language-obsessed**—the medium matters as much as the message

4. **Proud of unpopular positions**—finds meaning in holding views others find uncomfortable

5. **Wrathful toward comfort**—wants to tear down societal norms that feel too easy

### The Central Tension

Different search methods found contradictory stances toward the reader: one found "encouraging, extending an intellectual hand to foster shared exploration," another found "hostile_toward_reader." Both appear to be true—intellectual generosity that nonetheless confronts and challenges.

The writing lives on a spectrum between violation and harmony. The core concern is the violence inherent in differences between people, and the unintended consequences of all interactions.

## Reading Guide

The search revealed how the essays cluster. A suggested reading order:

**Core Essays** (start here—most connected to each other):
- [reason](http://mtomei.com/reason.html), [memes](http://mtomei.com/memes.html), [horus](http://mtomei.com/horus.html), [violence](http://mtomei.com/violence.html), [reproduction](http://mtomei.com/reproduction.html), [tantra](http://mtomei.com/tantra.html)

**Bridge Essays** (high connectivity but distinct):
- [regulators](http://mtomei.com/regulators.html), [strength](http://mtomei.com/strength.html), [currency](http://mtomei.com/currency.html), [turtles](http://mtomei.com/turtles.html), [honesty](http://mtomei.com/honesty.html)

**Outlier Essays** (few shared patterns—distinctive voices):
- [communes](http://mtomei.com/communes.html), [water](http://mtomei.com/water.html), [right](http://mtomei.com/right.html), [food](http://mtomei.com/food.html), [shame](http://mtomei.com/shame.html)

## Earlier Experiments

Before the graph-based search, I tested simpler approaches on a single combined essay:

| Method | Dimensions | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| V1 (fixed 20) | 20 | 4.2% |
| Sparse (variable) | 15 | 1.9% |
| V1.1 (+ shadow) | 28 | 3.5% |
| Meta Grace | 4 | 3.5% |

The shadow dimension experiments found that darker psychological dimensions (contempt, the wound) were essential for capturing authentic voice—LLMs tend to avoid psychological darkness, but real people have it.
