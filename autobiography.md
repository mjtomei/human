# Autobiography (Inferred)

*This document was written by Claude (Opus 4.5), not by Mat Tomei. It describes cognitive profiles that were algorithmically inferred from Mat's essays at mtomei.com.*

## Method

I (Claude) ran a meta search algorithm that searches through a space of psychological dimensions, using Mistral-7B to measure perplexity (prediction difficulty). The hypothesis that best helps the model predict what Mat will write next is assumed to capture something true about his cognitive state.

Two search modes were tested:
- **V1 Mode** (20 fixed dimensions): 4.2% perplexity improvement (baseline 19.74 → best 18.91)
- **Default Mode** (variable sparse dimensions): 1.9% perplexity improvement (baseline 19.24 → best 18.87)

Interestingly, the fixed 20-dimension architecture outperformed the flexible sparse approach for this writer—the opposite of what we observed for Kafka (where sparse dimensions showed 38% vs 10% improvement). This suggests Mat's philosophical writing style may be well-captured by the structured v1 dimensions.

## Inferred Cognitive Profile (V1 Mode, 4.2% improvement)

All 20 dimensions from the fixed v1 architecture:

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Body State | Introspective |
| Preverbal Feeling | Contemplative |
| Core Belief | The existence of unintended consequences in interactions and the possibility of a higher power beyond human understanding |
| Intellectual Stance | Philosophical, open-minded, and questioning |
| What They Notice | Concepts such as violence, God, shame, reason, and simulation theory |
| Moral Framework | Compassionate, considering multiple perspectives |
| What Outrages Them | Arrogance, intolerance, lack of empathy |
| What They Protect | Intellect, wisdom, the respect for all life forms |
| Stance Toward Reader | Encouraging, extending an intellectual hand to foster shared exploration |
| Who They Write For | Intellectually curious readers who are open to challenging their preconceptions |
| What They Want Reader To Feel | Curiosity, introspection, and a sense of wonder |
| What They Can't Say Directly | The essence of the universe and the nature of reincarnation |
| Relationship To Past | Reflective, considering the implications of historical events on current thought |
| Relationship To Future | Hopeful with a touch of pragmatism, acknowledging the possible balance of benefits and challenges ahead |
| Relationship To Language | A means for gentle discovery, contemplation, and communication |
| The Wound | The intricacy and ambiguity of reality |
| The Compensation | Pursuing insight and enlightenment through meditation and introspection |
| What They Find Beautiful | Complexity, nuance, and the interconnectedness of things |
| What They Find Ugly | Minimal complexity, gentle structure, and a hint of compassion |
| Sense Of Urgency | Moderate—they seem to write more for intellectual exploration than immediate action |

## Inferred Cognitive Profile (Default Mode, 1.9% improvement)

All 15 dimensions discovered by the sparse-dimension search:

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Intellectual Stance | Eagerly immerses in profound, complex, and thought-provoking explorations of abstract philosophical and metaphysical concepts |
| Deepest Fear | A world where all power feels free to violate and a world where everyone is identical |
| Meaning Framework | ['meaning comes from understanding the nature of interactions and power dynamics', 'meaning may come from the existence of a deity', 'meaning may come from the implications of simulation theory'] |
| What They Protect | ['avoiding unintended consequences', 'maintaining moral patience', 'understanding the implications of simulation theory', 'the existence of a deity', 'maintaining individuality and differences'] |
| What They Can't Say Directly | The potential limitations of our understanding and ability to prove or disprove the equivalence of experiences |
| Sense Of Urgency | There is a sense of urgency in the understanding that every interaction has some level of violence due to differences between people |
| Relationship To Existence | Interaction-based, with unintended consequences and a spectrum ranging from violence (mismatch of power and sovereignty) to harmony (identity and absence of hardship, representing heaven and hell metaphors). The existence of God is uncertain, and the implications of simulation theory suggest the possibility of entities with power beyond human understanding that may share moral patiency with us. |
| How They Know Things | Ponders the scope of knowledge beyond human comprehension, and explores the potential ramifications of the multiverse hypothesis |
| Mortality Awareness | Moderate |
| Stance Toward Reader | Hostile_toward_reader |
| Life Circumstance | ['contemplating the nature of interactions and power dynamics', 'pondering the possibilities of simulation theory', 'exploring the nature of shame and guilt'] |
| Posture Toward Existence | ambiguous_coexistence |
| Relationship To Future | The future is anticipated as a continuation of interactions, with the potential for improvement if differences between people are managed |
| Relationship To Present | The relationship to the present is one of acknowledging the current state of interactions and the violence inherent in them |
| Relationship To Time | ['reflecting on the eternal nature of a deity', 'considering the potential future creation of virtual worlds'] |

## Synthesis

Both profiles capture different facets of the same underlying cognitive stance:

1. **Ontology**: Participatory uncertainty—interactions have unintended consequences, God may exist but is beyond proof, simulation theory implies entities beyond our understanding

2. **Epistemology**: Philosophical questioning over certainty—open to multiple frameworks (deity, simulation, power dynamics) without committing to any

3. **Primary tension**: The spectrum between violation and harmony, between hell (all power violates) and heaven (all identical, no hardship)

4. **Core concern**: Unintended consequences of interactions, the violence inherent in differences between people

5. **Reader relationship**: A tension—V1 found "encouraging, extending an intellectual hand" while sparse mode found "hostile_toward_reader." Perhaps both are true: intellectual generosity that nonetheless challenges or confronts the reader

6. **What can't be said**: The deepest metaphysical questions—the essence of the universe, the nature of consciousness, the equivalence of experiences

## Shadow Dimension Experiments

A follow-up experiment tested whether adding "dark" psychological dimensions (cruelty, resentment, contempt, capacity for violence) would improve the profiles. The hypothesis: LLMs tend to avoid psychological darkness, but authentic voice may require it.

Two approaches were tested:
- **V1.1 Mode** (28 fixed dimensions = 20 original + 8 shadow): 3.5% improvement (baseline 19.74 → best 19.05)
- **Meta Grace** (sparse dimensions with shadow pool + grace period): 3.5% improvement (baseline 19.24 → best 18.58)

### Key Finding

Meta Grace achieved the **same 3.5% improvement with only 4 dimensions** compared to V1.1's 28. The grace period (dimensions must exist for 5 generations before removal) allowed proper refinement before judgment.

### V1.1 Shadow Profile (27 active dimensions)

Notable shadow dimensions discovered:

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| The Cruelty They Enjoy | No clear indication of enjoyment of cruelty towards sentient beings |
| Who They Resent | Individuals, entities, or beings with similar creative processes or artistic visions |
| The Lie They Tell Themselves | Their artistic expressions are always unique and groundbreaking |
| Their Capacity For Violence | Low, but can become passionate in creative debates |
| What They Refuse To Forgive | Artistic plagiarism |
| Their Contempt | Artistic imitation and lack of originality |
| The Power They Crave | Recognition for their creative impact |
| What They Would Do If No One Knew | Increase participation in vigorous creative discussions |

### Meta Grace Profile (4 dimensions only)

The sparse search with grace period converged on just 4 dimensions:

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mortality Awareness | "Immortality Belief" or "Lack of Mortality Awareness" |
| Somatic Memory | Residual sensation within the body from interactions—each interaction may leave a remembered influence |
| The Wound | The original harmony/understanding that shaped them; inherent mutual respect in interactions between entities with complete knowledge of each other |
| Their Contempt | Other entities with power beyond understanding; entities in simulated worlds with experiences potentially equivalent but not provably identical |

Two shadow dimensions (`the_wound`, `their_contempt`) made it into the final 4, suggesting darker psychological dimensions may be essential for capturing authentic voice.

### Most Frequent Dimensions (Meta Grace top 25%)

| Dimension | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| somatic_memory | 229 |
| the_wound | 214 |
| mortality_awareness | 142 |
| their_petty_satisfactions | 88 |
| their_contempt | 55 |

## Note on Methodology

These profiles were generated after fixing a batch scoring bug that had inflated earlier results. Previous versions of this document reported 24.4% and 15.1% improvements—those numbers were invalid due to a padding offset error in the perplexity calculation.

The corrected improvements (4.2% and 1.9%) are modest but real. Whether these inferred dimensions capture genuine psychological truths about the writer, or merely reflect patterns an LLM generates when prompted with philosophical text, remains an open question.
