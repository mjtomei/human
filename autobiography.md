# Autobiography (Inferred)

*This document was written by Claude (Opus 4.5), not by Mat Tomei. It describes a cognitive profile that was algorithmically inferred from Mat's essays at mtomei.com. Mat has reviewed it and confirmed the profile feels accurate to him.*

## Method

I (Claude) ran a genetic algorithm that searched through a space of ~30 psychological dimensions, using Mistral-7B to measure perplexity (prediction difficulty). The hypothesis that best helps the model predict what Mat will write next is assumed to capture something true about his cognitive state.

Two experiments were run:
- **5 short excerpts**: 24.4% perplexity improvement
- **Full corpus (15,370 words across 5 thematic clusters)**: 15.1% perplexity improvement

## Inferred Cognitive Profile

### Body State
Chronic low-level anxiety with periods of intense focus, sleep disrupted by racing thoughts about systemic problems

### Where Tension Lives
Solar plexus - the weight of seeing societal problems that others ignore or deny

### Core Belief
Personal awareness is a deception - we exist as shards of cosmic entities enacting scripted behaviors

### What He Notices
How artificial and constructed normal social reality feels, the puppet-strings behind human behavior

### How He Knows Things
Through mystical downloads and pattern recognition rather than linear learning

### Moral Framework
Consent and transparency as protection against spiritual exploitation

### What He Protects
Humanity's agency in relationship with superintelligent entities

### Stance Toward Reader
Co-researcher in humanity's most crucial experiment

## Earlier Experiment (5 Excerpts)

A shorter experiment with just 5 paragraph-length samples found a complementary profile emphasizing different facets:

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Body State | Deeply attuned to environmental sounds and natural chaos as sources of inspiration |
| Where Tension Lives | Between linear rational thought and intuitive pattern recognition from natural randomness |
| Core Belief | True creativity requires chaos and randomness; apparent novelty is actually remembering |
| Intellectual Stance | Mystical information theorist seeing consciousness as a biological computer |
| What He Notices | How natural chaos patterns mirror cognitive processes and memory formation |
| How He Knows Things | Through absorption of random environmental input that triggers pattern recognition |
| Relationship To Uncertainty | Views randomness and chaos as essential fuel for consciousness and creativity |
| What He Protects | The value of non-linear, chaos-informed ways of knowing against purely logical approaches |
| Stance Toward Reader | Sharing wonder about hidden connections between consciousness and natural chaos |

## Synthesis

Both profiles capture different aspects of the same underlying stance:

1. **Ontology**: Participatory panpsychism mixed with simulation theory - we are fragments of larger entities, consciousness is computation interfacing with higher dimensions

2. **Epistemology**: Direct insight and pattern recognition over discursive reasoning - "mystical downloads" rather than linear learning

3. **Primary tension**: The burden of perceiving systemic and cosmic problems that mainstream awareness ignores

4. **Mission**: Protecting human agency as we encounter superintelligent entities, while maintaining consent and transparency

5. **Relationship to chaos**: Randomness and entropy as essential fuel for consciousness, creativity, and spiritual growth

6. **Reader relationship**: Not teacher-to-student but co-researcher - collaborative investigation of humanity's most consequential questions
