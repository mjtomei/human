She stepped back, breath clouding in the cemetery's amber lamplight, and checked the headstone again. *Harold T. Pemberton, 1943-2019, Beloved Father.* The same name on the folded paper in her coat pocket, the same dates, the same lie about being beloved.\n\nBut the coffin below was wrong. Too small. Too new.\n\nMargaret had spent six months planning this moment, rehearsing what she'd say when she finally found what Harold had hidden before he died. The safety deposit box key he'd swallowed rather than give up. The key that would unlock the truth about her sister's disappearance twenty-three years ago.\n\nNow, standing hip-deep in a hole that apparently belonged to someone else entirely, she heard footsteps crunching through the snow",
