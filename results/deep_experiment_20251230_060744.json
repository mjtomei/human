She counted backwards from ten, the way her therapist taught her, but her pulse kept hammering against her wrist like something caged.\n\nThree months of planning had led to this: standing in the hallway of her childhood home while her father slept upstairs, his medication rendering him heavy and still. The basement door had always been locked. Even as a child, even during the years when she'd been desperate enough to try.\n\nNow she had his keys.\n\nThe wood was older than she remembered, paint chipped around the edges where small fingers had once picked and worried. Her fingers. She'd forgotten that\u2014the way she used to stand here, listening to the sounds that leaked up through the floorboards. Sounds that stopped whenever footsteps approached.\n\nThe key slipped in easily, turned with a soft click that seemed to echo through the sleeping house. Maya's hand froze on the handle. There were some things, she realized, that you couldn't unknown once you knew them. Some doors that changed you just by opening.\n\nBut her father's breathing had grown labored lately, rattling and uncertain. Soon there would be no more chances for answers.\n\nShe pushed the door open and stepped into the dark.",

        "text": "Sarah found the note Tuesday morning, tucked between coffee filters she'd forgotten she owned. Her handwriting, definitely\u2014the way she always made her 'g's like tiny nooses\u2014but the words felt foreign in her mouth when she read them aloud: \"The blue house on Maple. Third window. Wait until the lights go out.\"\n\nShe'd been sleep-deprived for weeks, sure. Pulling doubles at the hospital while her landlord's eviction notice grew more yellow on her kitchen counter. But this? This was different. The paper was expensive, cream-colored stock she'd never buy. The ink was from her good pen, the one she saved for signing leases and birthday cards.\n\nSarah set the note on her kitchen table and stared at it while her coffee went cold. Outside, Mrs. Chen was already watering her roses, humming something that sounded like a lullaby. Normal Tuesday sounds. Normal Tuesday light slanting through her cracked blinds.\n\nBut there was no blue house on Maple Street. Sarah had walked that block a hundred times on her way to work, memorized every fence and mailbox. Maple was all brick colonials and white picket dreams. \n\nShe folded the note once, twice, then slipped it into her scrubs pocket. The paper felt warm against her palm.",

        "text": "The notification sound had become Emma's heartbeat\u2014a phantom pulse that echoed even when her phone lay silent on the nightstand. She'd developed a tell, pressing her thumb against the device's smooth face like checking for fever, that micro-movement so automatic her body performed it before her mind caught up.\n\nThree AM. The screen bloomed cold and blue in the darkness.\n\n*Seen 11:47 PM*\n\nNo reply. Again.\n\nEmma rolled the phone between her palms, a prayer wheel for the digitally devout. The message thread stretched back eighteen months\u2014a scroll of increasing desperation disguised as casual check-ins. *Hey stranger* becoming *thinking of you* becoming *we should catch up* becoming the current, pathetic *hope you're well.*\n\nThe woman in the profile picture smiled with someone else's eyes now. Same face, same carefully curated angles, but something fundamental had shifted. Emma recognized the look\u2014she'd seen it in mirrors, in windows, in any reflective surface that caught her unaware. It was the expression of someone who had been seen too clearly and found lacking.\n\nHer thumb hovered over the keyboard. One more message. Just one more, and then she'd stop. She'd promised herself this same bargain forty-seven times before.\n\nThe cursor blinked, patient as a predator.",

Sarah watched through the plexiglass partition, noting how the woman's wedding ring clicked against the counter with each tremor. Click, click, click.\n\n\"Everything alright?\" Sarah asked when the woman looked up, her eyes too bright, pupils dilated despite the fluorescent glare.\n\n\"Of course.\" The pharmacist's smile stretched thin. \"Just tired. Long shift.\"\n\nBut Sarah had worked retail long enough to recognize the signs. The way someone moves when they're carrying something heavy that no one else can see. The pharmacist sealed the bottle with unusual care, her fingers lingering on the label\u2014Sarah's name, Sarah's address, Sarah's anxiety medication that she'd been taking for three years without incident.\n\n\"Actually,\" the woman said, leaning closer to the window, \"I need to ask you something.\"\n\nSarah's stomach dropped. There was something predatory in the pharmacist's sudden stillness, the way her voice lowered to barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Do you ever feel like you're being watched?\"\n\nThe question hung between them like smoke. Behind the pharmacist, the pharmacy's back room door stood slightly ajar, and Sarah could swear she saw movement in the shadows beyond.",

She'd been standing at her kitchen counter, methodically arranging the paprika and cumin by color rather than alphabetically, when she noticed her reflection wasn't there in the chrome surface of the refrigerator.\n\nShe touched her face. Solid. Warm, even. Her wedding ring clinked against her cheekbone\u2014the sound sharp and real in the afternoon quiet.\n\nThe phone call from Dr. Morrison had come at 2:17 PM. Time of death, he'd said, was approximately 11:30 AM. She'd thanked him politely, the way she thanked the grocery clerk or the mailman, and hung up. Then she'd made herself a sandwich\u2014turkey and swiss, mustard, no mayo\u2014and eaten it standing over the sink while staring at the ceramic rooster Harold had brought back from their anniversary trip to Vermont.\n\nThe rooster was still there. She was still there. The kitchen smelled like cinnamon and the faint medicinal sweetness that had clung to Harold those last months.\n\nMargaret picked up the oregano, considered its place in her new system, and wondered if being dead would excuse her from hosting bunco on Thursday.",

        "text": "The basement smelled like overripe peaches when Maya found her sister's wedding dress floating in three inches of black water.\n\nNot floating, exactly. The silk had absorbed enough liquid to sink partway, creating pale islands of fabric that broke the surface like the backs of sleeping animals. The bodice had twisted, arms reaching toward the stairs as if the dress were trying to crawl back up to safety.\n\nMaya stepped carefully around the perimeter, her bare feet finding the dry concrete near the walls. The water hadn't come from outside\u2014no storm last night, no broken pipes she could see. It had simply appeared, dark as coffee grounds, carrying that cloying sweetness that made her molars ache.\n\nShe should call someone. The insurance company. A plumber. Her sister, maybe, though Sarah lived in Portland now and probably wouldn't care about a dress she'd worn once, six years ago, before the divorce.\n\nInstead, Maya crouched at the water's edge and watched small ripples spread across the surface, though nothing had disturbed it. The dress shifted slightly, fabric sighing against fabric, and she could swear she heard something underneath the sound\u2014breathing, maybe, or the wet echo of footsteps in a distant room.",
